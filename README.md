  <h1>Propositional Logic Helper</h1>
</div>

This project aims to complete the technical challenges proposed by Rosalvo Ferreira De Oliveira Neto, professor at Universidade Federal Do Vale Do SÃ£o Francisco(UNIVASF), in Logic for Computing subject. The project must meet the requirements mentioned in the section below. To achieve this, we designed the construction of a script using the Elixir programming language.

## Requirements

Given a logical propositional formula as input, the program must:

- Check if the formula is valid.
- Build the truth table of the formula.
- Display the semantic properties of the formula(tautology, contradictory, satisfiable, contingency).
- Display the conjunctiva normal form.
- Display disjunctive normal form.
